# Kevins developer Blog

In this project I will learn how to code. In the following my whole way from zero to web 4.0 hero will be documented. Based on this document the reader should be able to follow these steps and make the journey himself. 

## Project Structure

1. **Basic Setup**
   1. Docker  
   2. Visual Studio Code  
   3. GitHub  

## Basic Setup
My workflow was coding in VSC trough the Remote exporer extension on Ubuntu and deploying trough GitHub pages, while viewing small changes directly in my local Webserver trough a WAMP Stack.
### Docker

Linux is the recommended software for coding, if your device uses something else you should use Docker. You will find countless tutorials and can ask specific questions to your AI Assistent.  

If you use a Microwoft based software you have to use the WSL (= Windows Subsystem for Linus). Therefore you should install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/). Trough that you will also install WSL and Ubuntu.  

## Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
Visual Studio Code is an excellent developer tool and is recommended. As already mentioned, you should learn to overcome problems that you face while installing yourself.  



## GitHub
https://github.com/
Get to know github yourself and research its benefits. Create an account and set up your very own **repository**.
